============================== Project Overview =======================================

This project serves as a comprehensive guide to core Java concepts, focusing on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. It is designed for Java developers and students who wish to solidify their understanding of Java's foundational features. The project includes practical examples and implementations of key OOP concepts such as inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction, along with other essential Java functionalities.

*Classes and Objects: Demonstrates the creation and use of classes and objects.
Inheritance: Showcases single and multilevel inheritance, method overriding, and the use of the super keyword.
Polymorphism: Includes examples of method overloading and method overriding.
Encapsulation: Illustrates how to achieve data hiding and encapsulation using access modifiers and getter/setter methods.
Abstraction: Demonstrates the use of abstract classes and interfaces.
Core Java Concepts

**Exception Handling: Provides examples of try-catch blocks, throw, throws, and custom exceptions.
Collections Framework: Contains implementations using lists, sets, maps, and other collection classes.
Streams and File I/O: Examples of reading from and writing to files, as well as processing data using Java Streams.
Multithreading: Includes basic and advanced threading examples, synchronization, and inter-thread communication.
Generics: Demonstrates the use of generic classes and methods.
Design Patterns

***Singleton: Example of implementing the Singleton pattern.
Factory Method: Demonstrates the Factory Method pattern for object creation.
Additional Features

****Annotations: Custom annotation creation and usage examples.
Java 8 Features: Lambda expressions, functional interfaces, and Stream API usage.
Unit Testing: Incorporates JUnit for writing and executing test cases.
